# gwalign

Alignment routines for gravitational-wave signals in the
`lalsuite.gwsignal` format.

## Scope

This package provides utilities to align gravitational-wave signals
represented as `lalsuite.gwsignal` objects. It is not intended to be a
general-purpose waveform library.

## Status

Early development (API may change).
